* Show the $site_title variable in the actual title of the site, and the h1 at the top
* Make the h3 say the right number of images (look up how to see how many items are in an array in php. equivalent of .length in JS)

  * Inside the loop, for each photo, make an LI. 
    * Inside that LI put image with the src coming from the array data
    * Inside that LI put an h4 with the name coming from the array data
